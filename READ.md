Brief Description of the project
The Healthcare of a country plays a major role 
in defining a country’s development. It is the expenditure, 
quality, and accessibility of health services that govern the 
quality of healthcare. With this in mind, this research work 
intends to develop an IoT based healthcare kit that is portable, 
low cost, lightweight, and low power electronic health care 
system. It will record and monitor health parameters like 
temperature, ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. providing 
primary patient monitoring and care assistance to strengthen 
our country’s healthcare system from rural to urban sectors. 
The kit is accessible 24/7 as real time data can be stored and 
fetched from the cloud anytime and anywhere. A significant 
issue in rural India is the 1:10,000 ratio of doctor to patient, 
which is now resolved by this kit because doctors all over India 
can now access the data on their timeline. Also, our Rasa based 
NLP-powered AI bot helps in assisting patients in identifying 
their illness via credible symptom checking, providing 
remedies for their illness, scheduling doctor appointments, and 
notifying caregivers. A web app is also provided for our system 
to broaden usability.
